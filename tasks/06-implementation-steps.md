# Implementation Steps

## ✅ Phase 1: Basic Structure - COMPLETED
1. ✅ Set up Python MCP server boilerplate
2. ✅ Create data classes (Entity, Relation, KnowledgeGraph)
3. ✅ Implement JSONL storage (load/save methods)
4. ✅ Test basic file operations

**Results:** All basic structure components working correctly. Data classes include weight system, JSONL storage preserves all data including weights, error handling for missing files works properly.

## ✅ Phase 2: Core Operations - COMPLETED
1. ✅ Implement KnowledgeGraphManager class
2. ✅ Port existing CRUD operations from TypeScript
3. ✅ Add weight increment logic to search/open operations
4. ✅ Test all core operations

**Results:** All core operations implemented and tested successfully. KnowledgeGraphManager now includes:
- Entity operations (create, delete, add/delete observations)
- Relation operations (create, delete)
- Graph operations (read, search with weight increment, open with weight increment)
- New operations (prune entities, increment weights)
- Cascade deletion for data integrity
- Comprehensive test coverage with test_phase2.py

## ✅ Phase 3: Existing MCP Tools - COMPLETED
1. ✅ Set up MCP tool registration with proper handlers
2. ✅ Implement all 9 existing tools with complete MCP interface
3. ✅ Test tool interface, JSON responses, and schema validation
4. ✅ Verify weight increments work through MCP interface

**Results:** All 9 existing tools successfully implemented as MCP tools with proper registration, schema validation, and error handling. MCP server now provides:
- Entity operations (create, delete, add/delete observations) via MCP interface
- Relation operations (create, delete) via MCP interface
- Graph operations (read, search with weight increment, open with weight increment) via MCP interface
- Consistent JSON response format for all tools
- Complete input validation using JSON Schema
- Robust error handling with informative messages
- Weight system integration verified through MCP tool calls
- Comprehensive test coverage with test_phase3.py

## ✅ Phase 4: New Functionality - COMPLETED
1. ✅ Implement prune_entities tool
2. ✅ Test pruning logic
3. ✅ Implement conversation review tool
4. ✅ Test conversation analysis and storage

**Results:** All new functionality implemented and tested successfully. Added:
- prune_entities MCP tool with threshold-based entity removal and cascade deletion
- review_conversation MCP tool with intelligent text analysis and entity extraction
- Pattern matching for persons, locations, organizations, and concepts
- Automated relationship creation between conversation entities
- Weight increment system integration with conversation analysis
- Comprehensive test coverage with test_phase4.py

## ✅ Phase 5: Integration Testing - COMPLETED
1. ✅ Test full workflow with comprehensive sample data
2. ✅ Verify weight system works correctly across all operations
3. ✅ Test conversation review end-to-end functionality
4. ✅ Validate JSONL storage format consistency
5. ✅ Test data persistence across multiple operations
6. ✅ Performance testing with larger datasets
7. ✅ Final system state and integrity verification

**Results:** Complete system integration validated successfully. Confirmed:
- All 11 MCP tools work together seamlessly in realistic scenarios
- Weight system accuracy across search, open, and conversation analysis operations
- End-to-end conversation analysis with proper entity extraction and storage
- JSONL storage format validation with proper field types and structure
- Data persistence and integrity maintained across all operations
- Performance acceptable with larger datasets (50+ entities)
- System stability and error handling under intensive testing
- Comprehensive test coverage with test_phase5.py (100% pass rate)
