## âœ… Phase 2: Core Operations - COMPLETED
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** Current

### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… Implemented KnowledgeGraphManager class methods
- âœ… Ported existing CRUD operations from TypeScript
- âœ… Added weight increment logic to search/open operations
- âœ… Tested all core operations

### Key Functionality Implemented:
- **Entity Operations:** create_entities, delete_entities, add_observations, delete_observations
- **Relation Operations:** create_relations, delete_relations  
- **Graph Operations:** read_graph, search_nodes, open_nodes
- **New Operations:** prune_entities, increment_weights
- **Weight System:** Automatic increments during search/open, manual increments available
- **Cascade Deletion:** Relations automatically deleted when entities are removed

### Verified Functionality:
- All CRUD operations work correctly with duplicate handling
- Weight increments work automatically in search_nodes and open_nodes
- Weight increments work manually via increment_weights
- Prune entities removes low-weight entities and cascades to relations
- Delete entities cascades to remove related relations
- All operations preserve data integrity across save/load cycles

### Test Results:
- Created comprehensive test script (test_phase2.py)
- All 10 core operations tested and verified
- Weight system working correctly with proper increments
- Cascade deletion verified for both pruning and manual deletion

## âœ… Phase 3: Existing MCP Tools - COMPLETED
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** Current

### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… Set up MCP tool registration with proper handlers
- âœ… Implemented all 9 existing tools with MCP interface
- âœ… Created comprehensive tool schema definitions
- âœ… Tested tool interface and JSON responses
- âœ… Verified weight increments work through MCP interface

### Key Functionality Implemented:
- **MCP Tool Registration:** Proper `@app.list_tools()` and `@app.call_tool()` handlers
- **Entity Tools:** create_entities, delete_entities, add_observations, delete_observations
- **Relation Tools:** create_relations, delete_relations
- **Graph Tools:** read_graph, search_nodes, open_nodes

- JSON Schema validation working for all tool inputs
- Weight system integration verified through MCP interface
- Error handling provides clear feedback for invalid inputs
- All tools return consistent JSON response format
- Tool responses compatible with MCP client expectations

### Test Results:
- Created comprehensive test script (test_phase3.py)
- All 9 MCP tool interfaces tested and verified
- Weight increment functionality confirmed through MCP calls
- JSON serialization/deserialization working correctly
- Data persistence verified across MCP tool operations

## âœ… Phase 4: New Functionality - COMPLETED
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** Current  

### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… Implemented prune_entities MCP tool with threshold-based entity removal
- âœ… Implemented review_conversation MCP tool with intelligent text analysis
- âœ… Added pattern matching for entity extraction (persons, locations, organizations, concepts)
- âœ… Integrated weight increment system with conversation analysis
- âœ… Added cascade deletion for pruned entities and their relations
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite for new functionality

### Key Functionality Implemented:
- **prune_entities Tool:** Removes entities with weight below threshold, cascades to relations
- **review_conversation Tool:** Analyzes conversation text to extract and store entities/relations
- **Smart Entity Extraction:** Pattern matching for persons, locations, organizations, concepts
- **Automated Relationship Creation:** "mentioned_with" relations between conversation entities
- **Weight Integration:** Automatic weight increments for mentioned entities
- **Memory Management:** Efficient pruning for long-term knowledge graph maintenance

### Verified Functionality:
- Prune entities correctly removes low-weight entities and cascades to relations
- Conversation analysis extracts 8+ entities from sample conversation text
- Weight increments work correctly for both new and existing entities
- Entity extraction handles multiple types (person names, locations, organizations, concepts)
- MCP tool registration and JSON schema validation working correctly
- All new tools integrate seamlessly with existing 9 tools

### Test Results:
- Created comprehensive test script (test_phase4.py)
- All prune_entities operations tested: threshold filtering, cascade deletion
- Conversation analysis tested: entity extraction, relation creation, weight increments
- Pattern matching verified for person names (First Last format)
- Keyword detection confirmed for locations, organizations, and concepts
