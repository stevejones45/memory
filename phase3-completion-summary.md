# Phase 3 Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 3: Existing MCP Tools has been successfully completed. All 9 existing MCP tools have been implemented and tested with proper tool registration and JSON response formatting.

## Implemented MCP Tools

### Tool Registration
- **Tool List Handler** - `@app.list_tools()` provides schema definitions for all 9 tools
- **Tool Call Handler** - `@app.call_tool()` routes and executes tool calls with proper error handling
- **JSON Response Format** - All tools return consistent JSON responses with success/error status

### Entity Tools
1. **create_entities** - Creates multiple entities with name, type, observations, and weight
2. **delete_entities** - Removes entities and cascades to delete related relations
3. **add_observations** - Adds new observations to existing entities (no duplicates)
4. **delete_observations** - Removes specific observations from entities

### Relation Tools
5. **create_relations** - Creates multiple relations between entities (no duplicates)
6. **delete_relations** - Removes specific relations from the knowledge graph

### Graph Query Tools
7. **read_graph** - Returns entire knowledge graph as JSON with entities and relations
8. **search_nodes** - Searches entities by query and increments weights automatically
9. **open_nodes** - Gets specific entities by name and increments weights automatically

## Key Features

### MCP Integration
- Full compliance with Model Context Protocol specification
- Proper tool schema definitions with JSON Schema validation
- Consistent error handling and response formatting
- All 9 tools properly registered and accessible via MCP interface

### Weight System Integration
- **search_nodes** and **open_nodes** automatically increment entity weights
- Weight increments persist across tool calls through JSONL storage
- Weight system enables importance tracking for future pruning

### Data Integrity
- All CRUD operations maintain data consistency
- Cascade deletion prevents orphaned relations
- Duplicate prevention for entities and relations
- Robust error handling with informative messages

## Testing Results
```

3. Testing search_nodes functionality...        PASS
4. Testing open_nodes functionality...          PASS
5. Testing add_observations functionality...    PASS
6. Testing delete_observations functionality... PASS
7. Testing delete_relations functionality...    PASS
8. Testing delete_entities functionality...     PASS

```

## Tool Schema Examples

### create_entities
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "entityType": "person", 
      "observations": ["works at Tech Corp"],
      "weight": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### search_nodes
```json
{
  "query": "coffee"  
}
```
Returns entities matching query with incremented weights.

### open_nodes  
```json
{
  "names": ["Alice", "Bob"]
}
```
Returns specific entities with incremented weights.

## Response Format
All tools return consistent JSON responses:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed",
  "data": "..."  // Optional result data
}
```

## Next Phase
Ready to proceed to Phase 4: New Functionality
- Implement prune_entities MCP tool
- Implement conversation review MCP tool  
- Test new functionality integration
- Verify end-to-end workflow

## Files Modified
- `src/memory_server.py` - Added complete MCP tool registration and handlers
- `test_phase3.py` - Created comprehensive MCP integration test suite
- `tasks/00-progress-tracker.md` - Updated progress status

Phase 3 successfully bridges the core knowledge graph operations with the MCP protocol, making all functionality accessible to MCP clients like Claude Desktop or other AI applications.
