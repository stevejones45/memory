# Phase 2 Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 2: Core Operations has been successfully completed. All essential knowledge graph management operations have been implemented and tested.

## Implemented Operations

### Entity Operations
- **create_entities(entities)** - Creates new entities, ignores duplicates
- **delete_entities(entity_names)** - Removes entities and cascades to delete related relations
- **add_observations(observations)** - Adds new observations to existing entities
- **delete_observations(deletions)** - Removes specific observations from entities

### Relation Operations
- **create_relations(relations)** - Creates new relations, ignores duplicates
- **delete_relations(relations)** - Removes specific relations

### Graph Operations
- **read_graph()** - Returns entire knowledge graph
- **search_nodes(query)** - Searches entities by name/type/observations + increments weights
- **open_nodes(names)** - Gets specific entities + increments weights

### New Operations
- **prune_entities(threshold)** - Removes entities with weight < threshold
- **increment_weights(entity_names)** - Manually increments weights for specified entities

## Key Features

### Weight System
- Automatic weight increments when entities are accessed via search_nodes or open_nodes
- Manual weight increments available via increment_weights
- Weight-based pruning to remove less important entities
- Weights represent conceptual importance/usage frequency

### Data Integrity
- Cascade deletion: when entities are deleted, related relations are automatically removed
- Duplicate handling: prevents duplicate entities and relations
- Error handling for missing entities and files
- Consistent JSONL storage format preservation

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite (test_phase2.py) with 10 test scenarios
- All operations verified to work correctly
- Weight increments tested and confirmed
- Cascade deletion verified
- Data persistence across save/load cycles confirmed

SUCCESS: All Phase 2 core operations tests passed!
```

## Next Phase
Ready to proceed to Phase 3: Existing MCP Tools
- Implement MCP tool registration
- Create tool interfaces for all 9 existing operations
- Test MCP integration and JSON responses
- Verify weight system works through MCP interface

## Files Modified
- `src/memory_server.py` - Added all core operations to KnowledgeGraphManager
- `test_phase2.py` - Created comprehensive test suite
- `tasks/00-progress-tracker.md` - Updated progress status
- `tasks/06-implementation-steps.md` - Marked Phase 2 complete

Phase 2 provides a solid foundation for the MCP server implementation with all essential knowledge graph operations working correctly.
