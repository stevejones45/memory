Not a filing cabinet but a dynamic network where insights emerge from weighted relationships and temporal patterns. Intelligence doesn't use memory, it IS the substrate dynamics of connection, weight evolution, and associative emergence. This system mimics biological cognition: ideas gain weight through importance/frequency, relationships form through co-occurrence, new insights emerge from unexpected connections. The substrate itself generates intelligence through its evolving patterns - a cognition amplification engine, not mere information retrieval."], "weight": 4, "type": "entity"}
